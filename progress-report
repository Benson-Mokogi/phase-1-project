Problem Statement
 In today's fast-paced and stressful world, people are seeking companionship more than ever.
  Dogs are not just pets; they are loyal and loving companions that can provide a sense of comfort, reduce anxiety, and promote overall well-being.

That's why I am passionate about creating an application that provides essential information about dogs as pets. By providing users with valuable insights about dog breeds, their behavior, and how to handle them, my app can help promote responsible dog ownership and ensure that pets receive the care they deserve.

In a world where stress and loneliness are prevalent, my app can also serve as a platform that connects dog owners and fosters a community of like-minded individuals.
